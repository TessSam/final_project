## Next R hurdle to tackle

# Scott "Dad jokes for days," Wallner

## Challenges faced along the way
- data wrangling
  - cleaning name 
  - large data sets
  - many separate data files for participants and conditions
  - needed to use both long and wide formats

## Victories and things to celebrate
- making GIFs
- super neat plots
- research question was answered
- hypothesis was correct

## Challenges you are still facing
- make some plots prettier

## Next R hurdle to tackle
- remove outliers and re-run analysis
- run a power analysis
- adapt and develop the study
- run an online study
- replicate with cellular automata and 3D dynamic fractals

# Project Background and Introduction

## What are fractals?

:::: {style="display: flex;"}

:::{}
- Invented by Benoit Mandelbrot in 1980
- *"Clouds are not spheres. Mountains are not triangles."*
- Measure of "roughness" called dimension
- Self similarity and scale invariance
- Mathematically or algorithmically generated

## Where are fractals?...Everywhere!
Fractals are pervasive in natural processes.
